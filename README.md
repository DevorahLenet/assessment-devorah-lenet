Obviously many of the points in the spec were not 
fullfilled. Please keep in mind that I'm newish to React
(I started learning it about 1.5-2 weeks before doing this assesment). 
I'm confident that with even just a bit more practice
my speed will increase and I'll be able to do much
more of that project or any project in a smaller amount
of time.

Regarding my job application in general, I'd like to 
refer you to Faige Herman as a referrence. I worked under
her in my previous position at Tangoe. She mentioned
that she worked at Integralytic in the past and would 
be happy serve as a reference for me.
